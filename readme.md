# Flat UI Colours Palette 🎨

I have been using [https://flatuicolours.com](https://flatuicolors.com) since my earliear coding days but many a times i work offline, it feels difficult to Load a website just for copying a Color Code. Hence I made my Own Google Chrome Desktop App 😍.

This is an Awesome app with Animation and It is Very Fast and It has an Always on top Feature too.
